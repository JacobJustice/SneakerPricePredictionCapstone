# SneakerPricePredictionCapstone
Senior Capstone for Computer Science undergrad at Appalachian State University

# Overview
The goal of this project is to be able to predict the average resale price of a sneaker, using a limited amount of information, primarily image data.

# Structure
There are three components to the project and I've split them into three submodules. If you wish to use my code for this task, you'll have to collect data yourself using the web-scraper, clean the data (auto-cropping, removing irrelevant features, etc.), and then use my price prediction script to fit a model that will be able to make predictions about future sneaker releases.

Success has been mild so far but I'm hoping that future versions utilizing more advanced modelling techniques will see more success.
